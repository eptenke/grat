## Priorities/Roadmap

### Arm Selection

The first priority is evaluating the current robotic arm projects for a likely candidate.  It needs to be:
* programmable
* affordable
* extensible
* sturdy enough
* open source

The Annin AR2 and AR3 look promising, but the hardware and servo kits are more than $800 alone.  Similar with evez0r.  

Perhaps if we were clever with one of the arms available on Amazon for less than $200?  Even the weaker arms might be able to accomplish much using simple machines and mechanical advantage.

Anyway, selection of arms discussion can be taken up in the email list.  Drop in and say Hi. 

### Assembly Analysis

We will need to think about the basic tasks of bot assembly, and what that might eventually look like.  There is no need that an assembler/disassembler end up as a robotic arm.  It seems a good fit, but perhaps we can imagine something better.  Arm selection above is merely for bootstrapping.  This asks more the question of what we want our bot to look like.

Bots need not be the only thing a grat can assemble.  Perhaps there is commercial value in assembling other things (eg Ikea).  How might that inform assembly design?
