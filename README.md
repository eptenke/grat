GRAT Robotics Assembly Toolkit

## What is GRAT?

GRAT aims to be a robotic platform for assembling and disassembling other open source robotic projects.

In the early days of programming, the first compilers revolutionized programming, allowing collaboration on a far greater scale than previously.  A compiler that could create a compiler, as well as compile other programs, allowed one to work at a higher symbolic level, leaving assembler work for those portions that truly required optimization.  Programs could be developed for multiple platforms, and developers from these multiple platforms could work together on the same codebase.

The current state of open source hardware is analogous to programming directly in machine code.  GRAT aims to be a robot assembler/disassembler, enabling one to keep up with updates in various open hardware projects.  We have come to expect being able to "make; make install" for software, and it can create the software with little intervention.  We want to do the same for robotics projects, and we believe that such a robot compiler would bring open source robotics and its collaboration to an unparalleled new level.

## Why?

Firstly, because it is hard to keep up with developments in the open source hardware world.  There are barriers to entry in terms of technical knowhow and monetary resources that a bootstrapping process could circumvent, much like bootstrapping BSD ports onto a given architecture.  GRAT would help one evaluate proposed commits to robotics projects, keep up to date with the current branches of various projects, and generally be the indispensable compilers, linkers, and repositories that we have come to value in the software world.

Secondly, because robotics are threatening jobs worldwide, and this project aims to stand in the gap, democratizing robotics, enabling desktop manufacturing on a wide scale, and generally bringing the equity gains from using and owning robotics into the common user's grasp.  Coupled with such projects as RepRap for printing, and FarmBot for agriculture, we start being able to meet very real needs in a manageable way.  As such, this project must be open source, free of corporate control, as the people's means to supply for itself, even if currency may be hard to come by.
